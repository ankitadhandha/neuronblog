# Atrazine

- Atrazine is a herbicide of the triazine class. 
- Atrazine is used to prevent pre and post-emergence broadleaf weeds in crops such as maize (corn) and sugarcane and on turf, such as golf courses and residential lawns.
- It is one of the most widely used herbicides in the US
- It was banned in the European Union in 2004 because of persistent groundwater contamination.
  No MRL in CODEX
- In the United States as of 2014, atrazine was the second most widely used herbicide after glyphosate,[1] with 76 million pounds of it applied each year.
- Its effect on yields has been estimated from 6% to 1%, with 3–4% being the conclusion of one economics review.
- Atrazine degrades in soil primarily by the action of microbes.
